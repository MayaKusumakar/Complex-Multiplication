# Complex-Multiplication
## Problem

The program multiplies two complex numbers together. Complex numbers have the form A*i + B where

A is the imaginary part of the number B is the real part of the number i is the imaginary unit and i * i = -1

The program asks the user for 2 complex numbers, multiplies them together, and then displays the result.

## Requirements
  - The program must compile with the -Wall, -Werror, and -Wextra options enabled

## Assumptions
  - All input is valid

## Additional Notes
There can be any number of spaces between a, the plus sign, b, and i and your program should be able to handle this

# Examples

## Example 1
Enter the first complex number in the form ai + b: 5i + 3

Enter the second complex number in the form ai + b: 2i + 4

(5i + 3) * (2i + 4) = 26i + 2

## Example 2
Enter the first complex number in the form ai + b: 10 i + 3

Enter the second complex number in the form ai + b: 6i+1

(10i + 3) * (6i + 1) = 28i + -57

## Example 3
Enter the first complex number in the form ai + b: 1i+2

Enter the second complex number in the form ai + b: 3 i + 4

(1i + 2) * (3i + 4) = 10i + 5
